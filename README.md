All domains also work under HTTPS, but primarily __test under HTTP__!

## Why

Sometimes people notify us of connectivity problems.
This system can remotely be run to quickly determine where these problems lie.
Generally its not our problem, and a recruiter can easily send this to any ITer to actually fix a problem

## How

1. Send a recruiter who reports any problem one of the above links
1. Let them share the results
1. Indicate this is clearly their problem
1. Offer to let one of our IT guys to help (if high end client only!)
